## 3D print

Hexapod is assembled by the 3D printeed STL files in this folder. 

#### Leg part:
The required number of each "Leg" is:
* 3d_twist_mount x 1 (x6 = 6)
* 3d_twist_ring x 2 (x6 = 12)
* 3d_twist_ring_b x 2 (x6 = 12)
* 3d_Servo_top x 1 (x6 = 6)
* 3d_Servo_bottom x 1 (x6 = 6)
* 3d_Leg_2xServo_top x 1 (x6 = 6)
* 3d_Leg_2xServo_bottom x 1 (x6 = 6)
* 3d_leg_crew_t x 1 (x6 = 6)
* 3d_leg_crew_b x 1 (x6 = 6)
* 3d_leg_crew_c x 1 (x6 = 6)
* 3d_leg_crew_p x 1 (x6 = 6)

#### Body part:
* 3d_board_up x 1
* 3d_board_bottom x 1

#### Misc part 
(these are optional, depends on how you want to mount electonics part)
* 3d_7688_mount x 1
* 3d_dcdc_mount x 1

## Assemble instruction

#### Leg (exploded view)

Each leg require:
* M2 screw 20mm x 5 (x6 = 30)
* M2 screw 8mm x 4 (x6 = 24)
* M2 screw 6mm x 3 (x6 = 18)
* M2 nuts x 5 (x6 = 30)

#### Hexapod (exploded view)

![Hexapod exploded view](images/hexapod_exploded_view_all.png)

Still require:
* M2 screw 8mm x 24

to mount all 6 legs onto the body
